# Data Structures in Java

### Implementation of various data structures in Java...
I am trying to implement or rather recreate various data structues in Java primarily using the Java Generic Framework...
<br>I have currently been able to make data structures like Singly Linked List, Circularly Linked List and Doubly Linked Lists...
<br>I'm planning to implement various other data structures later on...<br>

### Singly Linked List
In a strongly typed language like Java, linked lists help in storing different data types...<br>
We can use also it to store a single data type as well
```java
SinglyLinkedList<Object> list1 = new SinglyLinkedList<>();
SinglyLinkedList<Integer> list2 = new SinglyLinkedList<>();
/*linked list list1 can store different data types,
whereas linked list list2 can only store Integer data type
*/
```
Another fact to be noted is that the elsments stored are not of primitive data types but rather the wrapper classes of the primitive data types, this in a way provides greater flexibility...
